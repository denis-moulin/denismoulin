            <h3>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize and improve our Services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to provide and improve the Service, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only on as described below.</p>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any Personal Information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at contact@weareheadlight.com</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>Will Headlight ever change this Privacy Policy?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on www.weareheadlight.com by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>What Information does Headlight Collect?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h5>Information You Provide to Us:</h5>
            <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process, information entered through the Headlight App, and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your first name, email, and phone number. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
            <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers opportunities to participate in studies, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our Services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by emailing us at contact@weareheadlight.com</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h5>In addition we may collect and process the following information:</h5>
            <ul class="list--stacked">
              <li class="list--stacked__item">If You contact Headlight, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</li>
              <li class="list--stacked__item">Details of transactions You carry out through our Website and of the fulfilment any sessions facilitated through the Site.</li>
              <li class="list--stacked__item">Information that you provide during sessions of sessions may be stored in compliance with the coach’s duties to maintain a record of services provided.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h5>Information Collected Automatically</h5>
            <p>Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognise your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. If you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices.</p>
            <p>We may use this data to customise content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h5>Information Collected From Other Websites and “Do Not Track” Policy</h5>
            <p>Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. When you turn on the Do Not Track function in your browser, we stop collecting the information from your browser that allows us to tailor advertisements and other content specifically to you that is based on your visits to our advertising partners’ websites. Specifically, we stop collecting information from the unique browser cookie that links your browser to visits to third party sites. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked. Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can’t and don’t make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser.</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>Will Headlight Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
            <p>We may de-identify or anonymise your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to third parties that we do business with. We also may combine your de-identified information with that of other users to create aggregate de-identified data that may be disclosed to third parties who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. For example, we may use information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of Headlight to understand community needs, to design appropriate programs and activities, and to assess real world validity and feasibility assessments.</p>
            <p>Third parties: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, unless otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>Business Transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
            <p>Protection of Headlight and Others: We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Headlight, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorised access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
            <p>We endeavour to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorised entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>What Personal Information can I access?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</p>
            <ul class="list--stacked">
              <li class="list--stacked__item">Name and password</li>
              <li class="list--stacked__item">Email address</li>
              <li class="list--stacked__item">User profile information</li>
              <li class="list--stacked__item">Any data you enter into the Service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at contact@weareheadlight.com</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>What choices do I have?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our special features.</p>
            <p>You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by contacting contact@weareheadlight.com. We may continue to use any information on an aggregated and/or de-identified basis even after the deletion of your account.</p>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <h3>What if I have questions about this policy?</h3>
            <div class="v-spacer"></div>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to contact@weareheadlight.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
