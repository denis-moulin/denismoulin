<p>Duuoo is a one-on-one meeting tool that improves relationships between managers and team members.</p>

<p>I helped the team to build their first app and landing page, finding ways to optimize the entire process involved in each 1-on-1. From planning meetings to curating talking points, setting agendas, providing insights about employee needs and driving high accountability, Duuoo ensures that managers never lose track and always stay on top of their team’s operations.</p>

<p>Further, Duuoo enables a level of communication that goes beyond day-to-day operational concerns, building trust and understanding between team members and their managers.</p>
