<p>Late 2016 I partnered with Jakob Marovt who at the time was running Cuely.</p>

<p>The app is meant to replace your metasearch on different operating system. Connected to all your favorite apps, Cuely helps you reach your documents, conversations and information quickly.</p>

<p>We planned to brush up Cuely app for marketing launch on various platform. Within a week I broke down the app into components and objects, organize them and style them to have one consistent look and good base for a design system.</p>

<p>I took some time to give his app a bit of personality to stand out.

<p>The team and service couldnâ€™t find their audience, and the app was shutdown.</p>
