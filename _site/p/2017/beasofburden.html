<p>While exploring solutions and problems linked to mental health, I worked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tokebarter/">Toke Barter</a> on a consumer-oriented approach to reducing anxiety.</p>

<p>Beast of Burden is an app that helps you to identify hidden pressures, or any sources of stress/anxiety, and leads you to develop habits to fix them.</p>

<p>You are paired with a Beast, your companion or alter-ego that relies on you to evolve. By engaging mini-challenges that explore internal and external pressures affecting your beast, you identify your own pressures.</p>

<p>Beast of Burden was one of my favorite projects of 2017. Here’s a sneak peak at one day of work exploring different concepts and mapping out the prototype journey.</p>

<p>Beast of Burden was one of our explorations into the field of mental health. Toke is now running the project outside of Founders studio. Our exploration of this field also led us to start Headlight, another project I worked on while at Founders.</p>
