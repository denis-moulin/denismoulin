<p>That’s how we started to talk about the frustrations of freelancing life at Founders. Many of us had struggled with the same around the same challenges in our time as freelancers.</p>

<h3 id="figure-app">Figure App</h3>

<p>As part of our exploration process, we went through rounds of interviews with freelancers, creating demos of prototypes around different features and ideas. Here are a few ideas we kept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We eliminate the complexity of creating a bank account by connecting to your existing business account (where you get paid)</li>
  <li>We help individuals stay financially afloat by putting aside taxes and VAT money from income</li>
  <li>Business expense tracking is vital, so let’s make it easy</li>
  <li>Life isn’t just working and paying your taxes, so we help individuals to set some money aside with simple savings</li>
</ul>

<p>We separate business and personal bank accounts. Registered users connect the bank account that receives freelancer income to the Figure app.</p>

<p>A series of action cards help the user get onboarded, set up automated taxes and VAT payments or an extra savings account.</p>

<p>The dashboard is the principal view in the Figure app but each “account” (e.g. Business/Taxes/Savings) use the same layout and same transactions list.</p>

<p>Each transaction can be edited to generate automation, as shown below. By categorizing this expense as the appropriate VAT business expense, Figure will transfer a positive amount from your VAT account to your Business account.</p>

<p>The Figure app/prototype generated enough interest with different stakeholder groups for us to pursue building the first prototype. We’ve since handed it over to a dedicated team that is now running the company under the name of <a href="https://kontist.com/en">Kontist</a>.</p>
