<p>Dixie is a personal back-office service for your business.</p>

<p>Combining actionable insights with easy access to expert bookkeepers, Dixie makes it easy to turn your company’s back office from a burden into a highly valuable set of data and tools.</p>

<p>I helped the team to develop their product and tools, building both the customer- and the bookkeeper-facing app.</p>

<p>The main goal of the app is to help customers and companies stay on top of their bookkeeping by providing actionable insights around the most critical outstanding tasks or missing documents.</p>
