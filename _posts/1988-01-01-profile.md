Currently working with [](https://breather.com)[Hopper](https://www.hopper.com/) as product designer. <br><br> I like to think big, but I’m pragmatic in my day-to-day work and can take fast decisions on what needs to be done in the short term.
<br><br> While interface design is the core of my expertise, experience in front-end development and branding round out my perspective. I have experience managing multi-stakeholder creative processes and am self-motivated but able to adapt to different team structures.
<br><br> Based in {{ site.local }}.
